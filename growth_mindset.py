        A growth mindset is the belief that your abilities and intelligence can be developed through hard work, perseverance, and learning from your mistakes. 
        This concept was popularized by psychologist Carol Dweck, and it challenges the notion that our skills are fixed from the start. 
        Instead, it reminds us that every challenge is an opportunity to learn and improve.
